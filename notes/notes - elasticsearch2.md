***
Ensure security is enabled in your elasticsearch.yml:
`xpack.security.enabled: true`

Set up users and roles:
Use the Elasticsearch API or Kibana to create roles and users. Here's an example using the API:
```   
curl -X POST "localhost:9200/_security/role/search_role" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
   {
     "indices": [
       {
         "names": [ "creatorss" ],
         "privileges": [ "read", "view_index_metadata" ]
       }
     ]
   }'
```
 
1. Role:
A role is a set of permissions that define what actions can be performed on which resources in Elasticsearch. In the context of Elasticsearch security:
It specifies what indices a user can access.
It defines what operations (like read, write, delete) a user can perform on those indices.
It can also include cluster-level permissions.

Create a user:
```
   curl -X POST "localhost:9200/_security/user/search_user" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
   {
     "password" : "search_password",
     "roles" : [ "search_role" ],
     "full_name" : "Search User"
   }'

```
2. User:
A user is an entity that can authenticate with Elasticsearch. Users are assigned roles to determine their permissions. In your example;

Configure Elasticsearch:
Set up the security settings on your Elasticsearch instance as described in the previous response. This includes enabling X-Pack security, creating roles and users, and setting up the appropriate permissions.

```   
ELASTICSEARCH_DSL = {
       'default': {
           'hosts': 'your_elasticsearch_host:9200',
           'http_auth': ('search_user', 'search_password')
       },
}
